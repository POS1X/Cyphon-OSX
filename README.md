Cyphon-OSX
==========

A DoS Cannon based on Shell

Warning : This runs off an extremely LOW bandwidth. The source is only for the payload used for the DoS.

Development would be  updated every week / month. Follow @pos1x to keep up with Cyphon's update. Credits to @RSnake
for making the payload open source. 

Cyphon OSX : Purely Mac based DoS tool, offering IP an HTTP dos attacks. Currently, I am writing a modified payload
with help from the Slowloris(RSnake) and XerXes (Th3J35t3r). Main motive is to make this run on high bandwidth
as currently you require multiple devices to accomplish an attack.

Warning : Use this at your own risk.
